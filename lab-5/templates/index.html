      <p id="covid">The data presented here is likely skewed by the actual number of reported cases and the on-hand availability of said data to/from outside countries. Additionally, sanitation standards and reporting requirements are different for every country. CDC and other medical boards around the US require certain information be made avialable to the public for safety and this is not always a requirement for other countries.
